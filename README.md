# OpenQ-Fullstack

Welcome to OpenQ! The world's simplest crypto-powered bounty system.

Let's get you started.

## OpenQ Microservices

The OpenQ fullstack consists of several containerized microservices and a local JSON RPC Ethereum node.

### Install

#### Get a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

[Create a PAT ](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with these scopes:

```bash
public_repo
read:org
read:user
```

Now export your PAT as an environment variable, to make it available to the install script:

```bash
export PAT=...
```

#### Prepare Repositories

If, and only if, you are using GitHub codespaces, you should [create another PAT ](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the scope: `repo` (Full control of private repositories) and then run the command:

```bash
git config --global url."https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

Note: make sure that the global `.gitconfig` file only contains one config for `insteadOf "https://github.com/"`.

To clone and prepare all repositories run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will automatically generate all necessary `.env` files.

### Boot

To boot with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), simply run:

```bash
./boot.sh
```

This starts the `docker-compose.yml` file you can find in `OpenQ-Fullstack/docker-compose.yml`.

### Forks

To install your own forked repositories, export an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENQ_FORKS=username/OpenQ-Frontend,username/OpenQ-Contracts
```

Then run `install.sh` again. If you have previously cloned any of the repositories, remove them first.

### Configuring Docker Desktop with more memory

It's likely you'll need to provision additional memory for Docker Desktop.

Preferences -> Resources -> Slide Memory to 16GB

## Connect Metamask to Local Testnet

The OpenQ-Fullstack Boot will prepare a Hardhat Testnet on your machine at `http://localhost:8545`.

Add this Custom Network RPC URL by following the instructions [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC).

## Access Services

Each service will be exposed to your localhost at the following URLs for individual testing.

I suggest using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) if you'd like to hit a service directly.
